Our goal with this game is to provide a pleasant learning experience for students by learning biological functions such as respiration, digestion, and immune systems by using appropriate games that describe how our bodies work while we go about our daily routines, giving them a game where they can act as functional cells in his body and experience how our daily activities affect our bodies in a positive or negative way, and how they deal with this effect to keep us healthy.
